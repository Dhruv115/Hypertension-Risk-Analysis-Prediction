# Hypertension-Risk-Analysis-Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes risk factors associated with hypertension and builds predictive models to assess the likelihood of individuals developing hypertension. Through data exploration, feature engineering, and classification techniques, it aims to support data-driven insights into cardiovascular health.

## Features

Load and explore hypertension dataset (hypertension_dataset.csv)
Preprocess data: handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale inputs
Visualize relationships between features and hypertension outcomes
Train and evaluate classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
Compare model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
